/* This is used to enable code which passes library base references to be
 * compiled for OS4 without changes, by just redefining them as library
 * interface references. One limitation is that code that needs access to
 * both library base and interface, like library open code needs to be
 * handled separately - now handled in the startup code.
 *
 * Library function calling without changes for OS5 is still achived by
 * -D__USE_INLINE__.
